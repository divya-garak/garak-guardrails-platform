# NeMo Guardrails GCP Deployment - Status Summary

**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Endpoint**: http://35.197.35.26:8000  
**Status**: Infrastructure ‚úÖ | Configuration üîß In Progress

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ Successfully Deployed
1. **Infrastructure**: GKE cluster with 2-5 auto-scaling pods
2. **Load Balancer**: External IP accessible worldwide
3. **Health Monitoring**: Endpoints responding correctly
4. **Docker Image**: Python 3.10 with NeMo Guardrails installed
5. **Kubernetes Resources**: ConfigMaps, Secrets, Services all configured

### üîß Configuration Challenges

#### Issue Identified
NeMo Guardrails has strict configuration requirements that are causing deployment issues:

1. **Configuration Structure**: NeMo expects specific directory structures and file formats
2. **Validation Errors**: The framework validates configurations strictly, rejecting incomplete or improperly formatted configs
3. **False Positives**: Initial comprehensive security rules were blocking all requests due to configuration loading errors

#### Root Cause
The "false positive" issue was actually a configuration loading error. The system couldn't load the guardrails configuration properly, resulting in either:
- Empty responses (when config partially loads)
- 500 errors (when config fails validation)
- "Could not load configuration" messages

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Directory Structure Fix
- Created proper `/app/configs/default/` directory structure
- Used `--default-config-id` parameter
- **Result**: Configuration still not loading properly

### 2. Simplified Configuration
- Reduced complex security patterns to basic jailbreak detection
- Removed self-check flows that required prompt templates
- **Result**: Still experiencing configuration validation errors

### 3. Minimal Configuration
- Created bare minimum config with just model definition
- Simple Colang rules without complex patterns
- **Current Status**: Testing in progress

## Technical Findings

### NeMo Guardrails Requirements
1. **Strict YAML validation** for config.yml
2. **Specific Colang syntax** for rails.co files
3. **Prompt templates required** for certain flows (self_check_input, self_check_output)
4. **Directory structure matters** - expects configs in subdirectories

### Configuration That Works (Locally)
```yaml
models:
  - type: main
    engine: openai
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

```colang
define user express greeting
  "hello"
  "hi"

define bot express greeting
  "Hello! How can I help you?"

define flow
  user express greeting
  bot express greeting
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Example Configuration
Deploy with a known working configuration from NeMo Guardrails examples, then gradually add security features.

### Option 2: Local Development First
1. Test configuration locally with `nemoguardrails` CLI
2. Validate it works completely
3. Then deploy to GCP

### Option 3: Simplified Security Approach
Instead of complex Colang patterns, use:
- OpenAI's built-in content moderation
- Simple keyword blocking
- Basic pattern matching

## Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Deploy with minimal working configuration first
2. **Incremental Security**: Add security features one at a time after base deployment works
3. **Test Locally**: Validate configurations locally before deploying to GCP
4. **Documentation**: Follow official NeMo Guardrails examples exactly

## Current Action Items
- [ ] Get minimal configuration working on live endpoint
- [ ] Test basic chat functionality without security rules
- [ ] Gradually add security patterns one by one
- [ ] Validate each security feature before adding the next

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint accessible
- ‚úÖ Pods running and stable
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Chat API responding correctly
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Security features blocking malicious content
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Normal conversations working without false positives

## Conclusion
The infrastructure is successfully deployed and stable. The challenge is with NeMo Guardrails' strict configuration requirements. The recommended approach is to start with a minimal, known-working configuration and incrementally add security features while testing each addition thoroughly.
