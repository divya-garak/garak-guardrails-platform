# Security Policy

## üîí Security Notice

This repository has been sanitized for public viewing. All sensitive information has been removed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Considerations

### Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables must be set before deployment:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Redis instance password
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Google Cloud project ID
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase API key (if using authentication)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password

### Files to Create from Examples

Before deploying, copy and configure these example files:

1. `detect-dashboard/firebase-sa.json.example` ‚Üí `detect-dashboard/firebase-sa.json`
2. `detect-dashboard/terraform/terraform.tfvars.example` ‚Üí `detect-dashboard/terraform/terraform.tfvars`
3. `deployments/k8s-deployments/scripts/deploy_gcp_production_security.sh.example` ‚Üí `deployments/k8s-deployments/scripts/deploy_gcp_production_security.sh`

### Secure Configuration

1. **Never commit secrets**: All `.tfvars`, `.json` service account files, and `.db` files are gitignored
2. **Use Secret Management**: In production, use Google Secret Manager or Kubernetes Secrets
3. **Rotate credentials regularly**: Especially after any potential exposure
4. **Enable audit logging**: Track all API access and configuration changes

### Reporting Security Issues

To report security vulnerabilities, please email security@garaksecurity.com with:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation (if any)

Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
